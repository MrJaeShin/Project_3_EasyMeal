## Overview :

Meal planning app that lets user choose food ingredients that user would like to eat in a meal to a custom meal. 

If a user can't find the item they would like to add in the meal, user may input the item into the app using "add item page." User will have to input ingredient name and calories per serving size, as well as choose that category that ingredient belongs in. User may delete and update items.

User can see the meals that everyone created and see the detail of the meal, which in this case is meal name, ingredient name and calories, as well as calculated total calories. User can also delete meals.
